Stretch comes ready to run out of the box. The Xbox Teleoperation demo will let you quickly test out the robot capabilities by teleoperating it with an Xbox Controller.


Note: Make sure the USB Dongle is plugged into the the USB port of the base trunk.

To start the demo:

* Remove the 'trunk' cover and power on the robot
Wait for about 45 seconds. You will hear the Ubuntu startup sound, followed by two beeps (indicating the demo is running).
* Hit the Connect button on the controller. The upper two LEDs of the ring will illuminate.
* Hit the Home Robot button. Stretch will go through its homing calibration routine.
* **Note**: make sure the space around the robot is clear before running the Home function

You're ready to go! A few things to try:

* Hit the Stow Robot button. The robot will assume the stow pose.
* Practice driving the robot around.
* Pull the Fast Base trigger while driving. When stowed, it will make Stretch drive faster
* Manually stop the arm or lift from moving to make it stop upon contact.
* Try picking up your cellphone from the floor
* Try grasping cup from a counter top
* Try delivering an object to a person

If you're done, hold down the Shutdown PC button for 2 seconds. This will cause the PC to turn off. You can then power down the robot.

### Keyboard Teleoperating: Mobile Base

Begin by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
# Terminal 1
roslaunch stretch_core stretch_driver.launch
```

To teleoperate a Stretch's mobile base with the keyboard, you first need to switch the mode to *nagivation* for the robot to receive *Twist* messages. This is done using a rosservice call in a new terminal. In the same terminal run the teleop_twist_keyboard node with the argument remapping the *cmd_vel* topic name to *stretch/cmd_vel*.

```bash
# Terminal 2
rosservice call /switch_to_navigation_mode
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=stretch/cmd_vel
```

Below are the keyboard commands that allow a user to move Stretch's base.  
```
Reading from the keyboard  and Publishing to Twist!
---------------------------
Moving around:
   u    i    o
   j    k    l
   m    ,    .

For Holonomic mode (strafing), hold down the shift key:
---------------------------
   U    I    O
   J    K    L
   M    <    >

t : up (+z)
b : down (-z)

anything else : stop

q/z : increase/decrease max speeds by 10%
w/x : increase/decrease only linear speed by 10%
e/c : increase/decrease only angular speed by 10%

CTRL-C to quit

currently:	speed 0.5	turn 1.0

```
To stop the node from sending twist messages, type **Ctrl** + **c**.

### Create a node for Mobile Base Teleoperating
To move Stretch's mobile base using a python script, please look at [example 1](example_1.md) for reference.

### Keyboard Teleoperating: Full Body

For full body teleoperation with the keyboard, you first need to run the `stretch_driver.launch` in a terminal.

```bash
# Terminal 1
roslaunch stretch_core stretch_driver.launch
```
Then in a new terminal, type the following command

```bash
# Terminal 2
rosrun stretch_core keyboard_teleop
```

Below are the keyboard commands that allow a user to control all of Stretch's joints.  
```

              i HEAD UP

              , HEAD DOWN

              down-arrow                   


              w ARM OUT

              x ARM IN                     


              5 GRIPPER CLOSE              
              0 GRIPPER OPEN               

  step size:  b BIG, m MEDIUM, s SMALL     

              q QUIT                       

-------------------------------------------

```
To stop the node from sending twist messages, type **Ctrl** + **c**.


## Teleoperating in Gazebo


### Keyboard Teleoperating: Mobile Base
For keyboard teleoperation of the Stretch's mobile base, first [startup Stretch in simulation](gazebo_basics.md). Then run the following command in a new terminal.

```bash
# Terminal 1
roslaunch stretch_gazebo gazebo.launch
```

In a new terminal, type the following

```bash
# Terminal 2
roslaunch stretch_core teleop_twist.launch twist_topic:=/stretch_diff_drive_controller/cmd_vel linear:=1.0 angular:=2.0 teleop_type:=keyboard # or use teleop_type:=joystick if you have a controller
```
The same keyboard commands will be presented to a user to move the robot.

### Xbox Controller Teleoperating
An alternative for robot base teleoperation is to use an Xbox controller. Stop the keyboard teleoperation node by typing **Ctrl** + **c** in the terminal where the command was executed. Then connect the Xbox controller device to your local machine and run the following command.

```bash
# Terminal 2
roslaunch stretch_core teleop_twist.launch twist_topic:=/stretch_diff_drive_controller/cmd_vel linear:=1.0 angular:=2.0 teleop_type:=joystick
```
Note that the teleop_twist_joy package has a deadman switch by default which disables the drive commands to be published unless pressed. For a Logitech F310 joystick, this button is A.
