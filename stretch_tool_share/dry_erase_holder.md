## Dry Erase Holder

**Created by**: Hello Robot Inc

This tool allows Stretch to hold a dry erase marker.  It is spring loaded, allowing for compliant interaction between the marker and a white board. 

The tool can be integrated into your robot URDF by integrating its [stretch_description](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_tool_share/tree/master/tool_share/dry_erase_holder_V1/stretch_description) as described in the [Stretch ROS documentation](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_ros/tree/master/stretch_description).

1. Install the bolt into the dry_erase_bushing block and secure from below with an M5 nut.
2. Attach the dry erase bushing block to the tool plate, securing from below with the wrist_end_cap_5mm and an M5 nut. Orient the block so the marker points forward. 
3. Attach the shaft collar to your dry erase marker, approximately 8mm from the back of the marker.
4. Slide the marker into the bushing block. Loop a rubber band around the back of the marker and over to one of the pegs on the side of the bushing block. Repeat with the other peg.
5. The marker should now easily spring back when pushed against. You're ready to write!
