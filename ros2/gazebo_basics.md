# Spawning Stretch in Simulation (Gazebo)

!!! note
    ROS 2 tutorials are still under active development. 

!!! note
    Simulation support for Stretch in ROS 2 is under active development. Please reach out to us if you want to work with Stretch in a simulated environment like Gazebo/Ignition in ROS 2.

Refer to the instructions below if you want to test this functionality in ROS 1.

### Empty World Simulation
To spawn the Stretch in gazebo's default empty world run the following command in your terminal.

```{.bash .shell-prompt}
roslaunch stretch_gazebo gazebo.launch
```

This will bringup the robot in the gazebo simulation similar to the image shown below.

### Custom World Simulation
In gazebo, you are able to spawn Stretch in various worlds. First, source the gazebo world files by running the following command in a terminal

```{.bash .shell-prompt}
echo "source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh"
```

Then using the world argument, you can spawn the stretch in the willowgarage world by running the following

```{.bash .shell-prompt}
roslaunch stretch_gazebo gazebo.launch world:=worlds/willowgarage.world
```
