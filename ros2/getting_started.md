# Getting Started

This tutorial series covers writing ROS 2 software for Stretch. ROS 2 programs can be written in a variety of programming languages, but this series uses Python. We'll write programs that enable Stretch to navigate autonomously in its environment, manipulate objects with Stretch's gripper, perceive its environment, and much more.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that:

 1. Your Stretch has the latest software installed
    - These tutorials were written for Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS2 Humble. Take a look at the [Distributions & Roadmap](../../../software/distributions/) guide to identify your current distribution and upgrade if necessary.
 2. You are comfortable with Linux, the command line, and Python
    - If you are new to programming, check out the [Developing with Stretch](../../developing/basics/) tutorial series.
 3. Your Stretch is able to move freely about its environment
    - Use an untethered set-up to connect to your robot, such as Remote Desktop software or using SSH + ROS2 networking. These tutorials were written assuming you've set up the [Moonlight Remote Desktop software](../../getting_started/connecting_to_stretch#untethered-setup) from the Getting Started tutorial series.
