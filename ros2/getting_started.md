# Getting Started

This tutorial series covers writing ROS 2 software for Stretch. ROS 2 programs can be written in a variety of programming languages, but this series uses Python. We'll write programs that enable Stretch to navigate autonomously in its environment, manipulate objects with Stretch's gripper, perceive its environment, and much more.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that:

 1. Your Stretch has the latest robot distribution installed
    - These tutorials were written for the latest robot distribution. Take a look at the [Distributions & Roadmap](../../../software/distributions/) guide to identify your current distribution and upgrade if necessary.
 2. You are comfortable developing with Stretch
    - If you've never developed with Stretch before or are new to programming, check out the [Developing with Stretch](../../developing/basics/) tutorial series. In particular, the [Using ROS 2 with Stretch](#TODO) tutorial from that series is a good resource for those new to ROS 2.
