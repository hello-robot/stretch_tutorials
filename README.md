# Introduction

This branch provides instructions on the installation and use of code on the Stretch RE1 robot. The goal is to provide a user familiar with ROS 2 with the tools to operate a Stretch robot.

## Other ROS 2 Examples
To help you get started on your software development, here are examples of nodes to have the stretch perform simple tasks.

1. [Teleoperate Stretch with a Node](example_1.md) - Use a python script that sends velocity commands.  
2. [Filter Laser Scans](example_2.md) - Publish new scan ranges that are directly in front of Stretch.
3. [Mobile Base Collision Avoidance](example_3.md) - Stop Stretch from running into a wall.
4. [Give Stretch a Balloon](example_4.md) - Create a "balloon" marker that goes where ever Stretch goes.
