## Other ROS Examples
To help get you get started on your software development, here are examples of nodes to have the stretch perform simple tasks.

1. [Teleoperate Stretch with a Node](example_1.md) - Use a python script that sends velocity commands.  
2. [Filter Laser Scans](example_2.md) - Publish new scan ranges that are directly in front of Stretch.
3. [Mobile Base Collision Avoidance](example_3.md) - Stop Stretch from running into a wall.
4. [Give Stretch a Balloon](example_4.md) - Create a "balloon" marker that goes where ever Stretch goes.
5. [Get Joint States](example_5.md) - Get joint states of Stretch.
