## Getting the State of the Robot

Begin by starting up the stretch driver launch file by typing the following in a terminal.
```bash
ros2 launch stretch_core stretch_driver.launch.py
```

Then utilize the ROS command-line tool, ros2 topic, to display Stretch's internal state information. For instance, to view the current state of the robot's joints, simply type the following in a terminal.
```bash
ros2 topic echo /stretch/joint_states
```

Your terminal will then output the information associated with the `/stretch/joint_states` topic. Your `header`, `position`, `velocity`, and `effort` information may vary from what is printed below.

```
Additionally, if you type `ros2 topic list` in the terminal, you will see the list of active topics being published.

A powerful tool to visualize the ROS communication is through the rqt_graph package. You can see a graph of topics being communicated between nodes by typing the following.

```
ros2 run rqt_graph rqt_graph
```

The graph allows a user to observe and affirm if topics are broadcasted to the correct nodes. This method can also be utilized to debug communication issues.
