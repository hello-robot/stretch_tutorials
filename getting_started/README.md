# Tutorial Track: Getting to Know Stretch
New to Stretch? Welcome!

Please take the time to get to know your robot by going through these tutorials in order.

## What Version of Robot Do I Have?

Stretch RE1, Stretch 2, and Stretch 3 are very similar. One quick way to tell the difference is to look at the robot's hostname:

```{.bash .shell-prompt}
hostname
```
```{.bash .no-copy}
--- OUTPUT ---
stretch-re2-2001
```

Another way is to look for the distinctive  pink stripe on the base of Stretch 2:
